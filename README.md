Jaclyn M. Fingerhut, Romain Lannes, Troy W. Whitfield, Prathapan Thiru, Yukiko M.Yamashita

To reproduce the analyse please open the jupyter notebook run_everything.ipynb and follows the instructions.

If you want to reproduce the coverage plot you will need to align the data (see manuscript for parameters) and split the bam by strand (see the script : splitting_bam_per_strand.sh).
